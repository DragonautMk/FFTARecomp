# Extended saves (desktop debug option)

Open the pause menu, choose **Debug**, then enable **Extended saves** with
Left/Right, or Confirm and the ON/OFF selector. The default is OFF. The choice
is stored as `debug.extended_saves` in `av.cfg`, including portable
`Data/config/av.cfg`.

The [debug scene checklist](development/debug%20saves.md) assigns stable
DS-01 through DS-26 names/numbers to test situations, with evidence and explicit
validated/partial/uncovered status. The local ignored `saves/debug-cases/`
collection uses those same snapshot-slot numbers; partial slots remain candidates.
The expanded local collection is `debug_saves/ready/`, with separate USA/EUR
folders, an Italian usage guide and a provenance/status catalog. Its `IN-NN`
numbers select imported standard saves; `DS-NN` numbers select scene snapshots.
The entire root `debug_saves/` tree is ignored, including original containers,
converted saves, derived checkpoints and local metadata. The checklist records
region-specific validation and the remaining untested internal File No.2 entries.
Generated standard saves use GEN IDs: **GEN-30** is Sprohm before Decision
Time; **GEN-31** has Decision Time plus Prison Break active and White Magic
assigned; **GEN-33** resumes Prison Break through the game's **Resume Battle**.
File No.1 loads map progress for GEN-30/31. GEN-33 requires confirming the
resume summary, the warning and final Yes; an actual battle load is verified.
Master copies remain under ignored `debug_saves/generated/`, separately from
the numbered working family. **NEW-32** is factory-empty memory for naming
snapshots: select standard slot32 before loading DS-23 or variants53/54.
Loading snapshots restores SRAM and may flush it to the active standard file.
The guide lists **17 validated, 6 partial, 3 uncovered cases**, plus menu-ready
variant snapshots51–64, keeping those variant numbers distinct from DS IDs.

## Snapshot slots

The existing **Save states** page offers slots **1–99** while enabled, and
**1–9** otherwise. Left/Right wraps, so Left from slot 1 selects slot 99.
Previews, overwrite confirmation and the session's single Undo work as before.
Names remain `SaveStates/<ROM-SHA-256>/slot-1.ffstate` through
`slot-99.ffstate`, beside the selected `.sav`.

Disabling the option hides slots 10–99 without deleting or renaming them.
The picker moves back into the 1–9 range. Undo save for a hidden slot requires
enabling Extended saves again. State format, ROM/BIOS checks and native
translation compatibility are unchanged. See [Save states](save_states.md).

## Standard game saves

With Extended saves enabled, **Debug > Game saves** selects up to 99 cartridge
save files. Left/Right changes the selected number; Confirm on Slot advances
one number. The page shows the filename, whether the file is saved, empty or
unreadable, and which slot is active.

Slot 1 retains the existing filename. Slots 2–99 add the suffix `-slot-NN`
before its extension. In a portable bundle the files are:

```text
Data/saves/ffta.sav          (slot 1)
Data/saves/ffta-slot-02.sav  (slot 2)
...
Data/saves/ffta-slot-99.sav  (slot 99)
```

An installed or explicitly selected `my.progress.sav` uses
`my.progress-slot-02.sav`, etc., in the same directory. The two-digit suffix
`-slot-02` through `-slot-99` is reserved for numbering; reopening such a file
returns to the same family instead of appending another suffix. Existing
unnumbered saves are not renamed, moved or converted. Files copied manually
into these numbered paths appear on the next menu refresh.

- **Copy current save** copies the cartridge memory to the selected file.
  Save using the game's own command first: this copies ordinary saved progress,
  not the exact current scene or unsaved play. The active slot does not change.
  Replacing an occupied file requires explicit confirmation, initially on
  Cancel, and first protects its old contents in its own backup folder.
- **Use and restart** asks for confirmation, initially on Cancel, flushes the
  current cartridge memory to its old file, and boots the game on the selected
  file in the same window. Resume, then choose the game's normal Load command.
  An empty slot starts with erased cartridge memory for a new game.

Selection validates the destination's size and prepares a clean machine before
changing the active save. A bad file, failed backup, bad boot state or failed
source write leaves the current machine and active slot unchanged. An existing
destination is backed up before loading; it is not overwritten by the old
machine. The normal autosave and exit paths subsequently use only the active
filename. Switching clears snapshot Undo and resets frontend input/audio/video
history like Restart ROM; it is refused during input recording.

Each numbered file has its own [two backups](save_backups.md). Snapshot slots
remain shared per ROM and directory: loading a snapshot also restores cartridge
memory, which may later be written to the currently active standard slot.

Portable mode remembers only `debug.game_save_slot = 1..99`, so moving the
bundle keeps the selection valid. Installed mode remembers the selected path
through the existing shared-save preference. `FFTA_SAVE_PATH` still overrides
startup selection. Disabling Extended saves keeps the active standard file;
it hides the selection tools and preserves every file.

The filename and size checks do not validate the game's internal checksums.
The original game still decides whether an ordinary save is usable. This
feature changes the desktop workspace only; AndroidPort is separate.

## Validation

The Windows GNU release builds of the affected tests and production CLI pass
without compiler warnings. Wine runs pass 29 input/config tests, 39 menu tests
and 22 targeted runtime tests (3 numbered-save, 10 snapshot, 7 backup and
2 save-path tests); one existing optional resource-backed backup check is
ignored. The tests cover high-slot undo/preservation, exact numbered paths,
custom names containing dots, failed switch isolation and overwrite guards.
Picker rendering and mouse hit geometry are checked from 240x160 to 3840x2160.

Three normal Windows/Wine GUI sessions with keyboard input verify default nine
slots, enabling Extended saves, snapshot99 save/load/Undo and overwrite cancel,
disabling without deleting it, copying cartridge progress to slot99, safe
switch confirmation, an empty slot's erased memory, returning to slot99,
restart and moving the portable folder with an unrelated working directory.
The screenshots were inspected and source ROM/save/snapshot hashes remain
unchanged. Evidence is local under `target/extended-saves/`, including test
logs, `windows-build.json`, GUI captures and `gui-results.json`.

These GUI checks use Wine, interpreter execution and BIOS HLE, not native
Windows hardware or a physical gamepad. New Linux runtime checks, the optional
resource-backed check, release packaging and AndroidPort remain unverified.
