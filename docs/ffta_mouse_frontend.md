# Experimental EUR front-end mouse adapter

Enable FFTA_MOUSE=1. Move to select, left click to confirm, right click for
original B/back. Manual keyboard/gamepad input cancels queued mouse input.
Scene changes cancel pending clicks; empty areas are not targets. The same
logical 8x8 interaction grid and window/zoom coordinate conversion are reused.

Exact EUR SHA256 and short instruction checks are required. No ROM patching.
USA mouse front-end remains unchanged except for the name keyboard adapter.

2026-10-17: physical typing on the name screen queues the original glyph selector
and A, never writes the name buffer. ASCII upper/lowercase and digits are mapped;
Backspace sends B and Enter sends Start. Typed keys are consumed before gameplay
bindings, so A/B letters do not also trigger their mapped GBA buttons. Numeric
page selection uses the original L/R keys (EUR3 pages, USA2 pages). Unsupported
printable characters are consumed without triggering gameplay shortcuts.
USA checks: page commit0812AC2E, row-width literal0812AAB4 ->083A8320.
MEDIDO: simulated uppercase/lowercase/digit selection and one original confirm per
character, Backspace/Enter sequencing in both profiles. NO MEDIDO: real typing on
device, including the USA name-screen RAM signature; user acceptance pending.

Main selector write Thumb0813A736, short check0813A734=01300870.
Saved selector write Thumb0808BE74, caller0813E494; check0808BE72=28403070.
Name page write Thumb0812E81C; check0812E81A=01302070. Keyboard navigation
0812E5F8..0812E614 reads six row widths per page at ROM083AD2FE via literal
0812E6A0 (FED23A08). Row widths come from the user ROM, not copied game data.
Name Yes/No write Thumb08011BFA; check08011BF8=51400170. Its cursor cycles
OAM tiles0125..0127: all three animation frames must be accepted.

## Validation and limits

MEDIDO: complete boot, actual click on Press Start, Color Mode, TV, Saved Game,
Resume/Load selection. Another complete boot clicks New Game, then a private
synthetic A sequence advances story to the name keyboard. Mouse clicks exercise
letters, Delete, all three categories, OK and Yes/No. The story A sequence is a
test driver; arbitrary story dialogue clicking is not implemented here.

Changing language or backing out of Saved Game can restart the original title
sequence; this behavior is preserved. A separate run selected Italian and
confirmed the original language reload. Back from the language submenu was
also tested without reload. All investigations use blank/private save state;
no original save is written.

NO MEDIDO: loading/resuming a valid saved slot. Available save files contain
only FF bytes; the original game rejects empty Resume/Load. Actual populated
file-slot submenus are not adapted or claimed tested. Battle mouse controls,
USA front-end and physical mouse acceptance of this build remain pending.

Native replay of the recorded front-end clicks exactly matches the interpreter
framebuffer at1490 frames. USA and EUR extra=0 framebuffer AND OAM match their
previous original reference for600 frames each. Windows build is
 target/release/recomp-mouse-main.exe.

Private evidence: target/menu-click-all.*, target/menu-click-recorded.*, 
target/menu-click-native.*, target/menu-new-click-all.*, 
target/menu-new-symbol-click.*, target/menu-name-mouse-final.log.
